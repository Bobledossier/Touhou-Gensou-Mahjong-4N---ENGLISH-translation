# Touhou-Gensou-Mahjong-4N---ENGLISH-translation

***for Installation process, see the last section***

A repository to share the patched files and adress english typos (I assume a lot !) and translation mistakes (I assume none but I'm always open to improvement !)

東方幻想麻雀 / Touhou Gensou Mahjong is a property of D.N.A. Softwares and I'm translating and distributing my patch this for free with help from various peoples.

Touhou Gensou Mahjong is, as obvious as it souds, a Mahjong game. The "Real" Mahjong (not the pyramid find-the-pair one from Windows 95) using the Riichi rules. A very popular game in Japan, known for its dark past among yakuzas (as Poker was in Chicago) and nowadays played in a more relax way among friends and families. The original game has travelled worldwide, each country setting its own rules and pretty well known in the whole Asian continent and United States.

However, as any Touhou fangame must be, there is a twist to it.... You see, when playing a game, you'll be required to chose a character and a place from the Touhou franchise which will provides you with Spells and special extreme rules.

Want to feel the Saki powers ? Want to experience the Akagi mindgame ? Want to cheat the board like Tetsuya did ?

Here you go my friends !!

Touhou Gensou Mahjong has been released in several opus. This is the 4th one in the serie, the most cleaned one and the last released on PC.
That said, the "4N" version is an extension of the 4th version which brings EVERY characters and tables from the previous episodes. Rocketting its rooster to an amazing 108 unique characters !
(I bet even hardcore Touhou fans will not find a missing character in here haha)

Feel free to provide any feedback on the github itself or any social media ! (COMING SOON)

As a side note, the game had few bugs and un-completable achievements that I patched so it finally work.
This is not only a translation patch but a bugfix as well.
Please note that, in any cases, I didn't modify anything that would break the game when playing online against a player using an original, Japanese game.
So you'll still be able to play against Japanese players !

And big news for players already familiar with the game : I also implemented a Story Mode (from THMJ 1) with few special missions (I let you discover them) and a Replay Mode !
You'll never miss the nice Yakuman screenshot again ;)

And, finally : Have fun !!
